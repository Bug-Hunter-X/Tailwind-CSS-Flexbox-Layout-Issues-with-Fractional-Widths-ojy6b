```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a flexbox layout with two divs, one red and one blue, each taking half the width.  However, this can sometimes unexpectedly result in extra space between the divs or unexpected behavior in certain scenarios.
